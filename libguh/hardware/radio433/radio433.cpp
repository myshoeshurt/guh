  \class Radio433
  \brief The Radio433 class helps to interact with the 433 MHz receiver and transmitter.

  \ingroup hardware
  \inmodule libguh

  This class handles all supported radio 433 MHz transmitter. Receiving data on the 433.92 MHz frequency
  is only supported, if there are \l{Gpio}{GPIO's} available and a suitable receiver is connected to GPIO 27. Examples for receiver
  can be found \l{https://www.futurlec.com/Radio-433MHZ.shtml}{here}. The antenna has a very large impact on the quality
  of the signal and how well it is recognized. In many forums and blogs it is described that a 17, 3 mm piece of wire is enough.
  Experiments have shown, it's not. A 50 Ohm coaxial cabel (thickness = 1mm), mounted on the antenna pin of the receiver
  with a minimum distance of 5 cm away from the circuit and unisolated 17.3 mm at the end has shown the best results.

  In order to send data to a 433 MHz device, there currently are two possibilitis. If there are \l{Gpio}{GPIO's}
  available, the data will be sent over the transmitter connected to GPIO 22. Also in this case the antenna is a verry
  important part.

  The second possibility to sent data to a 433 MHz device is the \l{http://www.brennenstuhl.de/de-DE/steckdosenleisten-schaltgeraete-und-adapter/brematic-hausautomation/brematic-home-automation-gateway-gwy-433-1.html}
  {Brennenstuhl 433 MHz LAN Gateway}. If there is a Gateway in the local network, this class will automaticaly detect
  it and will be used. If both transmitter are available (Gateway + GPIO), each signal will be transmitted over both sender.

  \note: Radio 433 on GPIO's is by default disabled. If you want to enable it, you need to compile the source with the qmake config \tt{CONFIG+=radio433gpio}
